# 🛡️ Reflected XSS Vulnerability – `/vulnerable` Endpoint

## Description
The `/vulnerable` route reflects user input without sanitization, making it susceptible to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

## Reproduction Steps
1. Run the Flask app locally (`python app.py`)
2. Visit: `http://localhost:5000/vulnerable?input=<script>alert(1)</script>`
3. Observe the alert box or raw script output

## Risk
An attacker could inject malicious scripts that execute in the victim’s browser, leading to:
- Credential theft
- Session hijacking
- Browser exploitation

## Mitigation
- Escape user input before rendering
- Use templating engines that auto-sanitize
- Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)

## Status
✅ Vulnerability confirmed  
🔜 Patch pending

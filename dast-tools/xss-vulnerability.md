# üõ°Ô∏è Reflected XSS Vulnerability ‚Äì `/vulnerable` Endpoint

## Description
The `/vulnerable` route reflects user input without sanitization, making it susceptible to reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

## Reproduction Steps
1. Run the Flask app locally (`python app.py`)
2. Visit: `http://localhost:5000/vulnerable?input=<script>alert(1)</script>`
3. Observe the alert box or raw script output

## Risk
An attacker could inject malicious scripts that execute in the victim‚Äôs browser, leading to:
- Credential theft
- Session hijacking
- Browser exploitation

## Mitigation
- Escape user input before rendering
- Use templating engines that auto-sanitize
- Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)

## Patch Summary
- Replaced raw input reflection with `flask.escape()`
- Verified that `<script>` tags are no longer executed
- Re-tested with OWASP ZAP (no XSS flagged)

## Status
‚úÖ Vulnerability patched  
‚úÖ Re-scan clean

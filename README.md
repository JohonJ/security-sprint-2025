# 🔐 Security Sprint Portfolio – John Freeman

Welcome to my hands-on security portfolio, built during a focused 4-day sprint to deepen expertise in CI/CD, OWASP Top 10, DAST, SAST, SCA, SBOM, and threat modeling. Each folder demonstrates practical skills aligned with application security roles, including automation, vulnerability analysis, and secure SDLC practices.


## 📊 SAST: pip-audit Report

This repo includes a pip-audit scan of the Flask application, identifying known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
📍 [View the full report](sast-tools/pip-audit-report.md)

✅ Key Findings:

- `debug=True` detected in `app.py` → refactored to use environment variable:

```python
  import os
  app.run(debug=os.getenv("FLASK_DEBUG", "False") == "True")
```

✅ All vulnerabilities resolved as of Oct 3, 2025.  
Dependencies upgraded based on pip-audit findings:
- Flask → 2.3.2
- requests → 2.32.4
- gunicorn → 22.0.0
- idna → 3.7
- urllib3 → 2.5.0

Tested locally and verified with pip-audit: no known vulnerabilities.

📦 Note: This project uses a virtual environment (`venv-secure`) for dependency isolation.  
To install securely:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv-secure
source venv-secure/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

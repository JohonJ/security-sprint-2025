# 🔐 Security Sprint Portfolio – John Freeman

Welcome to my hands-on security portfolio, built during a focused 4-day sprint to deepen expertise in CI/CD, OWASP Top 10, DAST, SAST, SCA, SBOM, and threat modeling. Each folder demonstrates practical skills aligned with application security roles, including automation, vulnerability analysis, and secure SDLC practices.

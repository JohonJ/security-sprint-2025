# üîê Security Sprint Portfolio ‚Äì John Freeman

Welcome to my hands-on security portfolio, built over a focused 4-day sprint to deepen my expertise in CI/CD, OWASP, DAST, SAST, SCA, SDLC, AWS, and threat modeling. This project reflects my commitment to continuous learning and readiness for application security roles.
